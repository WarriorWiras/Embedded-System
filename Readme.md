## 📘 About This Repository

This repository serves as a **central workspace and archive for embedded systems projects**, with a strong focus on **low-level programming, hardware interaction, performance analysis, and system reliability**.

The projects collected here emphasise **hands-on engineering** rather than simulations working directly with microcontrollers, peripherals, storage devices, and communication interfaces under real-world constraints.

Each project is structured to reflect how embedded systems are designed, tested, and validated in practice.

---

## 🧠 Engineering Focus Areas

Across the projects in this repository, emphasis is placed on:

* ⚙️ Low-level driver development
* 🧩 Peripheral integration (SPI, SD, Wi-Fi)
* ⏱️ Precise timing and performance measurement
* 🗃️ Data integrity and structured logging
* 🛠️ Modular and maintainable firmware design
* 🔍 Testing, validation, and analysis workflows

These areas reflect core skills required in **embedded firmware engineering** and **systems-level development**.

## 📂 Repository Philosophy

This repository is organised to:

* Separate **driver testing**, **data output**, and **core system logic**
* Encourage incremental testing before full integration
* Preserve test results and artefacts for verification
* Maintain clear documentation at every level

Each major project contains its own documentation explaining internal design decisions and execution flow.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the embedded systems work:

* Browse individual project folders
* Read the project-specific `README.md` files
* Review code alongside generated output data

Projects are designed to be **self-explanatory** and navigable without prior context.
